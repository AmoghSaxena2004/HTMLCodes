        <h1>My Favorite Show</h1>
        <p class="styling">Ninja Hattori was my favorite show in my childhood. I always used to watch it in free time and since I was 90% free in childhood, I watched it whole day! The dubbing in hindi made it more funny as many phrases used, were just way too fun to listen. I would even say that if you haven't seen Ninja Hattori dubbed in hindi, being a hindi speaker, you should regret it.</p>
